--> Problem:

            Create your first application which has one activity. Create another activity named SecondActivity.Pass one number from the first activity and receive it on
            the second activity and show it in the UI. When the user presses the back button on the second activity, it must return the same number by multiplying it by
            2. (e.g. If the user has passed number 10 from the first activity, it should show 10 on the second activity but when the user presses the back button, it
            should return 20). Receive the returned number from the second activity on the first activity and display it on the UI.
            
            
--> Solution Summary:
                      
            So, first I downloaded Android Studio, then I created one project and selected Java as the programming language. After that, I created one activity, or we
            can say a page, where we had to write a code to send the number to another activity, and then I created a second activity where we got the number that we
            sent from activity 1, and after that, I added the back button concept so that we could fulfil the last statement where we had to multiply the number by 2.
            
            
--> STEPS AND IDEAS FOR WRITING THIS CODE:

            - Activity 1:
              
              - XML DATA
                  - TEXTVIEW: I used this to show the value using setText after multiplying by 2.
                  - EDITTEXT: I used this to take data(number) from user.
                  - BUTTON:   I used this to send data from 2nd activity.
                  
              - Activity.java:
                  - onClickListener : This method i used to button to add logic for sending data.
                  - Intent: I used this for navigating from mainActivity to SecondActivity with some data.
                  - onActivityResult: I used this acitivity for getting result after something completed in our case we finished our calculation.
                  
             
             - SecondaryActivity:
                
                - XML DATA
                     - TEXTVIEW: I used this to show number which we getting from mainActivity.
                     
                - SecondActivity.java:
                     - Intent: I used this to get extra data which i put when we send from mainActivity and i aslo i use new intent for multyping data by 2 and then
                     add that data and send to mainActivity by using intent.
                     
                - onBackPressed: This is default method which executed when we press andriod back button.
